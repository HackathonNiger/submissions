# Ayomama: Maternal Health & Community Platform

Ayomama is a comprehensive mobile application designed to empower expectant and new mothers with vital health information, personalized care, and a supportive community. It connects mothers with healthcare professionals and leverages AI to provide actionable insights, ensuring a healthier and more confident motherhood journey. Built with a robust Node.js backend and a modern React Native frontend, Ayomama is your digital companion for an exceptional maternal experience.

## Installation

To get the Ayomama platform running locally, follow these steps:

✨ **Prerequisites**:

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Expo CLI (install globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`)

🚀 **Backend Setup**:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ayomama-Health-Project/submissions.git
cd submissions/Backend-Ayomama

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Start the backend server in development mode
npm run dev
# Or in production mode
# npm start.
```

📱 **Frontend Setup**:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd ../Frontend-Ayomama

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# The Frontend uses environment variables configured via Expo.
# Ensure your `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is set in your environment or `app.json`
# to point to your backend (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```

Follow the instructions in your terminal to run the application on a simulator or physical device.

# Ayomama Backend API

## Overview

The Ayomama Backend API is a robust server-side application built with Node.js and Express.js, providing the core functionalities for the Ayomama maternal health platform. It leverages MongoDB for persistent data storage, integrates with a Groq AI model for conversational features, and uses external services like Twilio and Nodemailer for critical notifications.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, logout, and password reset functionalities for both mothers and Community Health Workers (CHWs) using JWT.
- **User Profile Management**: Allows users to update personal information, emergency contacts, and language preferences.
- **Antenatal Vitals Tracking**: Enables mothers to record essential health vitals, receiving AI-powered feedback.
- **AI Chatbot**: Provides an intelligent conversational agent powered by Groq for maternal health guidance and support.
- **Hospital Location Service**: Identifies nearby hospitals using OpenCage Geocoding and Overpass API data.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Manages the scheduling, retrieval, updating, and deletion of appointments for mothers.
- **Automated Reminders**: Utilizes node-cron, Twilio, and Nodemailer to send timely SMS and email reminders for upcoming appointments.
- **CHW Management**: Supports Community Health Worker registration and profile updates.
- **Patient Management**: Enables CHWs to assign patients and log detailed patient visit information.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up the Ayomama Backend API locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ayomama-Health-Project/submissions.git
    cd submissions/Backend-Ayomama
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `Backend-Ayomama` directory and populate it with the required variables as shown in the `Environment Variables` section below.
4.  **Start the Server**:
    ```bash
    # For development (with nodemon for auto-restart)
    npm run dev
    # For production
    # npm start
    ```
    The API server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

All required environment variables for the backend must be defined in a `.env` file in the root of the `Backend-Ayomama` directory:
