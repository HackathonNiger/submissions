## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser and a local web server to handle requests correctly. We recommend using `serve`.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- A Google Gemini API Key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Install a simple local server:**
    This project doesn't have a build step, so you just need a server to serve the static files. `serve` is a great, simple option.
    ```sh
    npm install -g serve
    ```

3.  **Set up your Gemini API Key:**
    The application code expects the Gemini API key to be available at `process.env.API_KEY`. Since there's no build process to inject environment variables, we'll simulate this.

    a. Create a new file named `env.js` in the root of your project directory.

    b. Add the following code to `env.js`, replacing `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual key:
    ```javascript
    // env.js
    window.process = {
      env: {
        API_KEY: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
      }
    };
    ```
    > **Security Note:** This method is for local development only. Never expose your API keys in the frontend of a production application.

4.  **Link the environment script:**
    Open `index.html` and add a script tag for your new `env.js` file. It **must** be placed *before* the main application script (`index.tsx`).

    ```html
    <!-- index.html -->
    <body class="bg-background-light dark:bg-background-dark font-display text-text-light dark:text-text-dark">
        <div id="root"></div>
        
        <!-- Add this line -->
        <script src="/env.js"></script> 
        
        <script type="importmap">
        {
          "imports": { ... }
        }
        </script>
        <script type="module" src="/index.tsx"></script>
    </body>
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    From your project's root directory, run the local server:
    ```sh
    serve
    ```
    The command will output a local address (usually `http://localhost:3000`). Open this URL in your web browser to see the app running!

## üîë API Keys

- **Google Gemini API:**
  - The key is required for the AI Support, Chatbot, and Voice Payment features to work.
  - You can obtain a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
  - Add this key to the `env.js` file as instructed above.

- **Paystack API:**
  - The project uses Paystack's test keys for resolving bank account numbers and handling card payments.
  - These test keys are currently hardcoded in `src/services/bankApi.ts` and `src/services/squadApi.ts`.
  - In a real-world scenario, these should be moved to a secure backend and accessed via environment variables.

## üìù Notes
this one is only for the demo and the fully function app is under construction
- **Persistence:** The application uses the browser's **Local Storage** to simulate a database. Your balance, transaction history, virtual cards, and KYC level will be saved in your browser. Clearing your browser's site data will reset the app to its initial state.
- **Permissions:** The Voice Payment feature requires microphone access. The app will prompt you for permission when you first use the feature.

# üì± USSD Code Installation (Africa's Talking Integration)

## üèÜ CodeFest Africa Hackathon Submission

This project demonstrates how to **install and configure a USSD code** using **Africa‚Äôs Talking API** to enable users to access services via mobile dial codes such as `*123#`.  
It focuses purely on **USSD setup and integration**, not full app features.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Overview

USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) allows users to interact with applications through short dial codes ‚Äî without needing internet access.  
This setup provides a simple backend endpoint to handle Africa‚Äôs Talking USSD requests and responses.

---

## üß∞ Requirements

Before installing, ensure you have:
- A **web server** (e.g. XAMPP, WAMP, or live host)
- **PHP 7.4+**
- **MySQL** (optional, for data storage)
- An **Africa‚Äôs Talking** account ‚Üí [https://account.africastalking.com](https://account.africastalking.com)
- A **registered USSD code** on Africa‚Äôs Talking sandbox (or production)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Installation Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ussd-installation.git
cd ussd-installation
2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Africa‚Äôs Talking Sandbox
Go to Africa‚Äôs Talking Sandbox

Set your Callback URL to your local or hosted endpoint, for example:

arduino
Copy code
https://your-domain.com/ussd.php
Add your USSD code, e.g. *384*1234#

Save the configuration

3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Your Local Server
If you‚Äôre testing locally:

Start Apache on XAMPP or WAMP

Place your project inside htdocs/ (e.g. C:\xampp\htdocs\ussd-installation)

Access via:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost/ussd-installation/ussd.php
```
STs data to your URL each time the user interacts

üßæ Environment Variables (optional)

You can store sensitive data in a .env file:
```
AT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AT_USERNAME=sandbox
```
```
