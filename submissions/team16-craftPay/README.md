# CraftPay â€” Digital Marketplace for Local Crafts

*CodeFest Hackathon Submission â€” Team 16*

CraftPay is a **React + TypeScript + PHP & MYSQL** web platform designed to connect **rural artisans** in Nigeria directly to **buyers across the country and beyond**.
The platform eliminates middlemen, giving local craft makers a fairer share of their earnings while offering buyers authentic, affordable, handmade products.

## Problem Statement

Rural artisans in Nigeria create unique, high-quality crafts but often lack access to digital marketplaces.
They rely heavily on middlemen (wholesalers and retailers), resulting in reduced profits and limited exposure.
The absence of a direct platform makes it difficult for these artisans to reach national or international customers.

## Our Solution

* Create accounts and list their products.
* Sell directly to buyers without middlemen.
* Manage orders, view analytics, and track sales performance.

Buyers can:

* Explore diverse handmade crafts from local artisans.
* Add or remove items from their cart.
* Create and view orders seamlessly.
