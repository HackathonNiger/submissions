## 🚀 Project Overview  
Counterfeit and substandard drugs are a major public health threat in Nigeria and across Africa. According to WHO, **1 in 10 medical products in Africa is substandard or falsified**, causing thousands of preventable deaths yearly.  

**VerifyMeds** is a **web application** built to empower consumers and pharmacists to **verify the authenticity of medications** before purchase using **QR codes and NAFDAC data**.  

Our solution makes it easy for:  
- **Consumers:** Scan a drug pack before purchase to confirm authenticity.  
- **Pharmacists:** Bulk-verify inventory to protect customers and build trust.  
- **NAFDAC:** Receive counterfeit reports to track and eliminate fake drugs.

## ✨ Key Features  
- 📷 **QR Code Scanning** – Verify drugs instantly using your camera.  
- ✅ **Drug Authentication** – Check drug ID, manufacturer, and batch against dataset.  
- ⏰ **Expiry Alerts** – Warns if a drug is expired or nearing expiry.  
- ⚠️ **Suspicious Reporting** – One-tap reporting of fake drugs to authorities.  
- 📊 **Pharmacist Dashboard** – Bulk verification with scan history and logs.  
- 💊 **Drug Info Cards** – Show dosage, side effects, and manufacturer details.

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository  

git clone https://github.com/Muayyad822/submissions.git
cd submissions


### 2. Install Dependencies


npm install


### 3. Run Development Server


npm run dev


## 📊 How the App Works

### Verification Methods

**1. QR Code Scanning**
- User opens camera modal and captures photo of QR code on drug packaging
- App uses **jsQR** library to decode the QR code data
- Decoded data is verified against NAFDAC database
- Results show authenticity, expiry status, and drug details

**2. Image Scanning (OCR)**
- User opens camera modal and captures photo of drug packaging text
- App uses **Tesseract.js** for optical character recognition to extract text
- Extracted text is searched for NAFDAC registration numbers or batch numbers
- Matching drugs are verified against the database

**3. Manual Input**
- User enters NAFDAC registration number (format: XX-XXXX or AXX-XXXXXX) or batch number (format: XXX-XXXXXXXX)
- Direct lookup in NAFDAC database for verification

**4. Search**
- User searches by drug name, manufacturer, or NAFDAC number
- Real-time search through NAFDAC dataset with fuzzy matching
- Click to select and view detailed drug information

### Technical Flow

1. **Camera Access:** Uses WebRTC `getUserMedia` API with mobile-optimized constraints
2. **Image Processing:** Canvas API for image capture and processing
3. **QR Decoding:** jsQR processes image data to extract QR code content
4. **OCR Processing:** Tesseract.js analyzes images to extract readable text
5. **Data Verification:** Searches JSON-based NAFDAC dataset for matches
6. **Expiry Calculation:** Compares current date with drug expiry dates
7. **PWA Features:** Service workers for offline functionality, install prompts

### Result Display

- ✅ **Verified:** Green interface showing authentic drug details
- ❌ **Counterfeit:** Red interface with reporting options
- ⚠️ **Warnings:** Yellow alerts for expired or expiring drugs
- 📊 **Details:** Product name, manufacturer, NAFDAC number, batch number, expiry date, active ingredients
