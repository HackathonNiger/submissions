## Problem Statement and Local Context

### The Challenge
Nigeria, with over 250 ethnic groups and 500+ indigenous languages, faces a critical challenge in digital inclusion and language preservation. While English serves as the official language, millions of Nigerians communicate primarily in indigenous languages like Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, and Edo/Bini. This creates significant barriers in:

- **Digital Communication**: Limited access to technology for non-English speakers
- **Educational Access**: Difficulty accessing digital educational content in native languages
- **Cultural Preservation**: Risk of language extinction due to limited digital presence
- **Economic Inclusion**: Barriers to digital economy participation for indigenous language speakers

### Local Context
According to UNESCO, Nigeria has several languages classified as "vulnerable" or "definitely endangered." The digital divide disproportionately affects rural communities where indigenous languages are predominantly spoken. Current translation solutions lack:
- Cultural context understanding
- Support for Nigerian indigenous languages
- Voice-based interaction capabilities
- Offline functionality for areas with poor internet connectivity
